#Biometric Device Integration for Frappe
This Frappe app integrates popular biometric devices like EBKN, Suprema, and ZKTeco with Frappe HRMS, enabling real-time or scheduled synchronization of attendance logs. It also allows creating and updating device users directly from the ERP.

##Features
1. Real-time Attendance Sync: Process logs as soon as they are sent by devices.
2. Scheduled Synchronization: Set up periodic (cron-based) synchronization for devices that do not support push protocols.
3. User Management: Create or update users on biometric devices directly from Frappe ERP.
4. Device Compatibility: Supports EBKN, Suprema, and ZKTeco devices, with options for easy extensibility to other brands.
